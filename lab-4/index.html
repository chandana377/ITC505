      <h2>Addendum: My Stylistic Choices</h2>

      <p><strong>Font Choices:</strong> I used <em>Georgia</em> for the main text as it is a serif font that enhances readability for long essays. For headings, I used <em>Arial</em> to create contrast and ensure a professional, modern feel.</p>

      <p><strong>Text and Heading Sizes:</strong> The body text is <code>18px</code> for comfortable reading on laptop screens. Headings gradually increase in size: <code>h1</code> = <code>36px</code>, <code>h2</code> = <code>28px</code>, <code>h3</code> = <code>22px</code>. This creates clear visual hierarchy.</p>

      <p><strong>Color Choices:</strong> The background is a soft cream (<code>#f9f9f9</code>) with dark gray text (<code>#333333</code>) for easy readability. Blue shades (<code>#2a4d69</code>, <code>#4b86b4</code>, <code>#adcbe3</code>) are used for headings to symbolize justice and peace — themes aligning with equality in the Constitution. Blockquotes use a subtle light blue background (<code>#f0f4f8</code>) to highlight the Preamble.</p>

      <p><strong>Margins and Padding:</strong> The container uses <code>40px</code> margin and <code>30px</code> padding to maintain clean whitespace. Paragraphs have bottom margins for spacing, and lists are indented for clarity. A soft box shadow and rounded corners give the design a modern, card-like appearance.</p>

      <p><strong>Images:</strong> Two relevant images — the Indian Flag and the Constitution — are displayed side by side using flexbox. Each image has a border and caption for accessibility and visual balance. This supports the essay’s theme visually and symbolically.</p>

      <p><strong>HTML Abuse:</strong> In Lab 2, I used <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the title due to size preferences. I corrected it to <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> here since it represents the main heading. I also replaced visual <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags with CSS-based margins for proper semantic structure.</p>

      <p><strong>Overall Layout:</strong> The page is centered, structured with semantic HTML, and visually balanced for laptop screens. The typography, color scheme, and image layout together create a professional, accessible presentation.</p>
